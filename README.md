Work in progress. Come back soon for more ðŸš€

## Motivation

I wanted to see how much time I was spending on each website and set limits for certain ones.
Unfortunately I only found paid solutions, or some that were not very estetically pleasing.

## Features

- Simple Dashboard
- Set limits for each host
- Powerful & flexible rules
- Import & Export data
- 100% Open Source & Local
- Set retention policy that deletes all logs older than a user specified number of days.
